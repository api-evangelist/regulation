    AWS Config is a fully managed service that provides you with an AWS resource
    inventory, configuration history, and configuration change notifications to
    enable security and governance. Config Rules enables you to create rules
    that automatically check the configuration of AWS resources recorded by AWS
    Config. With AWS Config, you can discover existing and deleted AWS
    resources, determine your overall compliance against rules, and dive into
    configuration details of a resource at any point in time. These capabilities
    enable compliance auditing, security analysis, resource change tracking, and
    troubleshooting.

    The AWS CloudHSM service helps you meet corporate, contractual and
    regulatory compliance requirements for data security by using dedicated
    Hardware Security Module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. With
    CloudHSM, you control the encryption keys and cryptographic operations
    performed by the HSM. AWS and AWS Marketplace partners offer a variety of
    solutions for protecting sensitive data within the AWS platform, but for
    applications and data subject to rigorous contractual or regulatory
    requirements for managing cryptographic keys, additional protection is
    sometimes necessary. Until now, your only option was to store the sensitive
    data (or the encryption keys protecting the sensitive data) in your
    on-premises datacenters. Unfortunately, this either prevented you from
    migrating these applications to the cloud or significantly slowed their
    performance. The AWS CloudHSM service allows you to protect your encryption
    keys within HSMs designed and validated to government standards for secure
    key management. You can securely generate, store, and manage the
    cryptographic keys used for data encryption such that they are accessible
    only by you. AWS CloudHSM helps you comply with strict key management
    requirements without sacrificing application performance. The AWS CloudHSM
    service works with Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). CloudHSM instances
    are provisioned inside your VPC with an IP address that you specify,
    providing simple and private network connectivity to your Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. Placing CloudHSM instances near your EC2
    instances decreases network latency, which can improve application
    performance. AWS provides dedicated and exclusive (single tenant) access to
    CloudHSM instances, isolated from other AWS customers. Available in multiple
    Regions and Availability Zones (AZs), AWS CloudHSM allows you to add secure
    and durable key storage to your applications.
