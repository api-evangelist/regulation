<table width="100%" border="0"><tr>

<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain</strong> - Management of a single domain, and its administrative information.</li>
<li><strong>Record</strong> - Management of all types of records for a single domain.</li>
<li><strong>Zone</strong> - Manage the zones for any particular domain.</li>
<li><strong>Registration</strong> - Being able to register new domains, purchase, and manage ownership and registrar.</li>
<li><strong>Cache</strong> - Allow for domain level caching of all requests made through the domain.</li>
<li><strong>IP Address</strong> - Ability to manage IP address information, and perform lookups.</li>
<li><strong>Geo DNS</strong> - Manage geographic specific details about domain operation.</li>
</ul>
</td>

<li><strong>Denial of Service (DDOS)</strong> - DNS tools for identifying and defending against a denial of service (DOS) attack.</li>
<li><strong>DNS Failover</strong> - Allowing for failover at the DNS level, providing redundancy and failover of DNS infrastructure.</li>
